    "\n",
    "    A detailed study of Random Forests would take this tutorial a bit too far. However, since it's an often used machine learning technique, gaining a general understanding in Python won't hurt.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In layman's terms, the Random Forest technique handles the overfitting problem you faced with decision trees. It grows multiple (very deep) classification trees using the training set. At the time of prediction, each tree is used to come up with a prediction and every outcome is counted as a vote. For example, if you have trained 3 trees with 2 saying a passenger in the test set will survive and 1 says he will not, the passenger will be classified as a survivor. This approach of overtraining trees, but having the majority's vote count as the actual classification decision, avoids overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Building a random forest in Python looks almost the same as building a decision tree; so we can jump right to it. There are two key differences, however. Firstly, a different class is used. And second, a new argument is necessary. Also, we need to import the necessary library from scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use RandomForestClassifier() class instead of the DecisionTreeClassifier() class.\n",
    "    n_estimators needs to be set when using the RandomForestClassifier() class. This argument allows you to set the number of trees you wish to plant and average over.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The latest training and testing data are preloaded for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",

    "    Fit your random forest model with inputs features_forest and target.\n",

    "    Remember how we looked at .feature_importances_ attribute for the decision trees? Well, you can request the same attribute from your random forest as well and interpret the relevance of the included variables. You might also want to compare the models in some quick and easy way. For this, we can use the .score() method. The .score() method takes the features data and the target vector and computes mean accuracy of your model. You can apply this method to both the forest and individual trees. Remember, this measure should be high but not extreme because that would be a sign of overfitting.\n",
